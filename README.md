This project was developed by BRAKJATE.QUANTUMCORE as part of a symbolic and sovereign AI engineering portfolio. It simulates key skills used in real-world AI/LLM engineering roles, including:

- Prompt design for complex domains (legal tech, structured Q&A)
- Small-scale fine-tuning using Transformers
- Independent code structuring and research-level simulation

Every file here was generated and validated through symbolic co-execution with a sovereign AI system.
